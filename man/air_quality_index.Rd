\usage{
air_quality_index(pm2.5_conc)
}
\arguments{
\item{pm2.5_conc}{the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the
air. Concentrations are reported as a 24-hour average, in micrometers per
cubic meter (Î¼g/m^3). The AQI index thresholds for PM2.5 concentrations
were taken from Table 4 of the AQI technical assistance document}

\description{
Purpose: to determine the air quality index level given a 24-hour
concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5). This function uses the United
States Air Quality Index (AQI), which determines levels of concern for
concentrations of the 5 major air quality pollutants. This application of the
AQI classification is specific to 24-hour average PM2.5 concentrations. PM2.5
is fine particulate matter that is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, small enough
to be inhaled into the lungs and bloodstream and cause long-term health
effects.

NOTE: thresholds for AQI levels in this function are specific to the United
States, this function does not apply to other countries with different index
thresholds
