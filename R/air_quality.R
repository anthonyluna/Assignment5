#' air_quality - a function for classifying air quality levels
#'
#' Purpose: to determine the air quality index level given a 24-hour
#' concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5). This function uses the United
#' States Air Quality Index (AQI), which determines levels of concern for
#' concentrations of the 5 major air quality pollutants. This application of the
#' AQI classification is specific to 24-hour average PM2.5 concentrations. PM2.5
#' is fine particulate matter that is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, small enough
#' to be inhaled into the lungs and bloodstream and cause long-term health
#' effects.
#'
#' NOTE: thresholds for AQI levels in this function are specific to the United
#' States, this function does not apply to other countries with different index
#' thresholds

#'
#' @param pm2.5_conc the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the
#'   air. Concentrations are reported as a 24-hour average, in micrometers per
#'   cubic meter (Î¼g/m^3). The AQI index thresholds for PM2.5 concentrations
#'   were taken from Table 4 of the AQI technical assistance document
